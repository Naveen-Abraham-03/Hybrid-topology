# Hybrid Network Topology using Scilab

## Description
This project implements a hybrid network topology using Scilab.  
The topology is a combination of:
- Star topology
- Ring topology
- Bus topology  

The implementation uses basic plotting functions to visualize the network
and calculates node degree, maximum degree node, and total nodes and edges.

## Tools Used
- Scilab 6.0.0
- Basic 2D plotting functions

## Contents
- `code/` – Scilab source code
- `output/` – Graph screenshot and console output
- `report/` – Word document for lab submission
